This script compresses each file in a specified source directory, appends the modification date and time to the filename, and moves the compressed files to a specified target directory. This can be useful for archiving files with their modification timestamps for better organization and retrieval.
Usage Instructions
Save the script to a file, e.g., compress_files.sh.
Make the script executable:

chmod +x compress_files.sh
Run the script with the source and target directories as arguments:

./compress_files.sh /path/to/source /path/to/target
Example
Source Directory: /root/rohan
Contains files: file1, file2
Target Directory: /backup
Running the script:


./compress_files.sh /root/rohan /backup
After execution, the /backup directory will contain:

file1_2024-07-17_14-23-05.tar.gz
file2_2024-07-17_15-30-12.tar.gz
Each compressed file includes the original file name and its modification timestamp.
